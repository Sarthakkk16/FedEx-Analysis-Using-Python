# FedEx-Analysis-Using-Python
This project provides a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a synthetic FedEx Logistics dataset containing over 2,000 shipment records.

**It covers real-world logistics KPIs such as delivery time, delays, shipping mode performance, origin–destination analysis, fuel cost, package value, and shipment reliability.**

# Project Objectives

Analyze FedEx shipping operations from multiple perspectives


Identify factors causing delivery delays


Compare logistics performance across origins, destinations, and shipping modes


Perform statistical tests to validate operational hypotheses


Engineer new features for predictive modeling


Build data preprocessing and visualization workflows

# Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels)


Matplotlib, Seaborn


Scikit-learn


Jupyter Notebook
